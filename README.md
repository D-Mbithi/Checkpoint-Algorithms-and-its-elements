# Checkpoint-Algorithms-and-its-elements

Solution to algorithm to count vowels, characters, and words in a sentence.

## Overview

This repository contains a JavaScript solution for analyzing sentences by counting:
- The number of vowels
- The number of characters (with and without spaces)
- The number of words

It is designed as a simple utility for string analysis and educational purposes.

## Features

- **Count vowels:** Identify and count all vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) in a given sentence.
- **Count characters:** Calculate total character count, with options to include or exclude spaces.
- **Count words:** Determine the number of words present in the input sentence.

## Usage

The solution is implemented in JavaScript. You can run the code in any JavaScript environment (browser, Node.js, etc.).  
Example usage:

```javascript
const sentence = "Hello, how are you?";
console.log(countVowels(sentence));    // Output: 7
console.log(countCharacters(sentence)); // Output: 18 (excluding spaces)
console.log(countWords(sentence));      // Output: 4
```
